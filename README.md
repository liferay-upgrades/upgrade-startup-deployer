# UPGRADE STARTUP DEPLOYER

The Module Deployer handles the deployment of all necessary submodules required by the module you intend to deploy. This ensures that, in OSGi, the bundle generated by your module is deployed only after all sub-bundles upon which it depends have been successfully deployed.

Note: So far, this tool only supports Gradle projects
